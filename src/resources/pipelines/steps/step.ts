/** ### `type Step`
 * Used to create the typing for any step object.
 *
 * ---
 * ### Dev Notes
 *
 * We need to setup the steps this way due to the unpredictability of the k:v inside
 *  the details details object.
 *
 * By setting up steps in this way we can extract the correct details typing for each
 *  individual step based upon the value input into the action. Since we tell TS the
 *  action will always only ever be a keyof our mapped steps type, TS can correctly
 *  infer the data inside the object AFTER action has been supplied in the step object
